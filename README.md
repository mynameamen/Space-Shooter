# Space-Shooter
Hello. my name is Amen a skher Cudjoe and for my final project of Harvard CS50 I created a game using Lua with LÃ–VE

The game is named space shooter and it's a side scrolling space adventure where the goal is to collect
as many aliens as possible and make it to the end without dying

It has a main menu which gives the user the options of starting the game or reading how to play. When started, you
control a space ship and travel across space dodging small asteriods, big asteriods and planets. You have a HUD in
the top left hand corner which displays your: health, speed, distance to go, and score.
being hit by a  small asteriod, big asteriod or planet will cause you health and to decrease by 25% and you speed to decrease
by 50 km/s if it is above 100 km/s. When you pick up an alien your health goes up by 25%, your speed increases by 50 km/s and
your score increases based on how fast you are going so going faster = more points.The fastest you can go in this game is
700km/h. When you reach the end you are greted by a victory screen which shows a different message based on how many points you,
the more points the better the message. If you die before you reach the end, you explode and go to the game over screen

And that is how the game I created works
